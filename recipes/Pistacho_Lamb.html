    <p>The pistachio and mustard crust gives this lamb dish an interesting flavor and texture. Sure, rack of lamb is a little pricey, but no more so than other special occasion meats like prime rib, beef tenderloin, or goose. And, because rack of lamb is sold completely trimmed, you'll have virtually no waste.</p>
    <ul> 2 racks of lamb, trimmed
    </ul>
    <ul> 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence </ul>
        <ul> salt and ground black pepper to taste
    </ul>
    <ul>  1 tablespoon vegetable oil
    </ul>
    <ul>  â…” cup chopped pistachio nuts
    </ul>
    <ul>  2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
    </ul>   
    <ul>  1 tablespoon melted butter
    </ul>    
    <ul>     1 teaspoon olive oil
    </ul>    
    <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste
    </ul>    
     <ul>
        3 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
        </ul>
<ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.                      
        Generously season each rack of lamb with herbes de Provence, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place lamb in skillet and cook, browning on 
        all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer lamb to a foil-lined baking sheet; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir pistachios, bread crumbs, butter, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and black pepper in
        a bowl. Spread mustard on the fat-side of each rack of lamb. Pat pistachio mixture on top 
        of mustard. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden and lamb is pink in the 
        center, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
